# torch jax transform

**Repo based on this advice:**

🧠 Don't use: TensorFlow 1.x / Legacy Keras

🚫 Why: Outdated (static graphs, hard to use); poor for modern AI like LLMs or custom loops.

🔄 Use instead: PyTorch (flexible & popular), JAX (speed on TPUs), HuggingFace Transformers + Diffusers (ready-made AI tools).

💡 Tip: New research papers mostly use PyTorch/JAX now – join the trend!

### ⚡️ PyTorch — "The crowd favorite"

* Made by Meta (ex-Facebook).
* Dynamic graphs = you can literally `if`, `for`, `while` inside your model.
* Super flexible, great for prototyping → also production-ready.
* Big community + add-ons (TorchVision, TorchAudio, etc).

**When to vibe with it:**  
You wanna tinker, break stuff, debug on the fly.

**Mini-quest:**  
[my\_torch.py](my_torch.py) → trains MNIST digits.  
(yes, the classic "can it see numbers?" test).

### 🚀 JAX — "Math, but on steroids"

* Made by Google.
* Feels like NumPy, but secretly… auto-grad + JIT compilation.
* TPU native = chef's kiss for scaling huge models.
* Functional style: pure functions, no side-effects.

**When to vibe with it:**  
You care about raw *speed* + want to play with research-level tricks.

**Mini-quest:**  
[my\_jax.py](my_jax.py) → gradient + JIT + vmap = lightning fast math magic.

### 🤖 Hugging Face Transformers + Diffusers — "The prebuilt toolkits"

* Transformers = NLP, vision-language, multimodal.
* Diffusers = text-to-image, generative vibes.
* Basically plug-and-play with *thousands* of pretrained models.

**When to vibe with it:**  
You don't wanna reinvent the wheel → you want sentiment analysis or Stable Diffusion *right now*.

**Mini-quests:**

* [my\_transformers.py](my_transformers.py) → sentiment analysis.
* [my\_diffusers.py](generate_image/my_diffusers.py) → text-to-image generation.

✨ TL;DR:

* PyTorch → flexible prototyping → backend for Hugging Face.
* JAX → crazy fast research → shines on TPUs.
* Hugging Face stuff → ready-made models → instant AI magic.
